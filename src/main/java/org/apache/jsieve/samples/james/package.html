<BODY>

<p>This package contains a sample implementation of a Mailet that invokes
jSieve to perform local mail delivery processing. The Mailet is implemented
by Class <code>JSieve</code>. The remaining classes implement supporting
behaviours. See the class comments for details.
</p>
<p>This code is for DEMONSTRATION purposes only and should not be considered
to be of production quality.
</p>
<p>Note that there is currently a dependency on 
<code>org.apache.james.utils.mail.mdn.MDNFactory</code>. This binds the 
implementation to versions of Apache James that include this class. To achieve
a truly portable Mailet implementation, the Mailet API may need to be extended
to include the ability to create an MDN.
