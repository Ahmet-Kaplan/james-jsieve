                        Release Notes
                        -------------

Apache JSieve is a Java implementation of the Sieve mail filtering language defined by 
RFC 3028. jSieve is implemented as a langauge processor that can be plugged into any
internet mail application to add Sieve support.

Comments, Questions and Issues
------------------------------
jSieve is a sub-project of Apache James. Please direct your comments and questions to 
the relevant James list.

To report issues, such as bugs, go to 
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSIEVE
As jSieve comes with a fairly extensive suite of jUnit Tests, it would be most 
helpful for bug reports to be accompanied by an illustrative jUnit test case.

Licensing and legal issues
--------------------------
For legal and licensing issues, please look in the legal section of
the documentation or read the LICENSE and NOTICE files.

Version 0.3
----------- 
This release is the first to include mailet and utility modules, in addition to the core parsing
library. The configuration API has changed significantly to replace magic singletons with POJOs
suitable for IoC. The default configuration mechanism has been retained so though calls have
changed, existing configurations should still be compatible.
 
Utilities include node serializers to xml and sieve script. The mailet module provides Sieve
in the James 3 codebase.
